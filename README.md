This repository contains the R codes for individual-based models mixing prefeences for content and indirect biases (conformity and prestige).

For both cases, traits are modeled either as discrete (a binary A/B choice) or a single continuos trait. The idea is to show that, when social influence is not associated to traits/trait values, cultural dynamics are determined by preferences for content, even if weak, as they are the only directional forces. 

For more information the (early) draft is available in this repository, as well as an [OSF Preprint](https://osf.io/7z4ws/)
