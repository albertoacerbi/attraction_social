This repository contains 

- the R codes for individual-based models mixing prefences for content and indirect biases (conformity and prestige). For both cases, traits are modeled either as discrete (a binary A/B choice) or a single continuos trait. For more information the draft is available as an [OSF Preprint](https://osf.io/7z4ws/) 

- the Python Notebook to reproduce the figures in the same draft.
