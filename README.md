# attraction_social

This repository contains the R codes for individual-based models mixing attraction and indirect biases (conformity and prestige).

For both cases, traits are modeled either as discrete (a binary A/B choice) or a single continuos trait. The idea is to show that, when social influence is not associated to traits/trait values, cultural dynamics are determined by attraction, even if weak, as it is the only directional force (in the discrete case, attraction is equivalent to biased mutation).
